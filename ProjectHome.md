libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several low-level networking routines, including

  * network address manipulation
  * kernel arp(4) cache and route(4) table lookup and manipulation
  * network firewalling (IP filter, ipfw, ipchains, pf, PktFilter, ...)
  * network interface lookup and manipulation
  * IP tunnelling (BSD/Linux tun, Universal TUN/TAP device)
  * raw IP packet and Ethernet frame transmission

Supported languages:

  * C, C++
  * Python
  * Perl, Ruby (see below)

Supported platforms:

  * BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, BSD/OS)
  * Linux (Redhat, Debian, Slackware, etc.)
  * MacOS X
  * Windows (NT/2000/XP)
  * Solaris
  * IRIX
  * HP-UX
  * Tru64

Builds cleanly on, but needs work - see TODO:
(please let me know if you have access to these systems!)

  * AIX
  * UnixWare
